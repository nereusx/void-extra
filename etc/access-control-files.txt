# Access Control Files
 
The access control software consults two files. The search stops at the first match.
 
Access will be granted when a (daemon,client) pair matches an entry in the /etc/hosts.allow file.
 
Otherwise, access will be denied when a (daemon,client) pair matches an entry in the /etc/hosts.deny file.
 
Otherwise, access will be granted.
 
A non-existing access control file is treated as if it were an empty file.
Thus, access control can be turned off by providing no access control files.
